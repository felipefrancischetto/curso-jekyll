## Welcome to my Jykill Style

I'm familiar with this tool, I like the ease of use and I have plans to use it.

Below is a simple example of the 'Markdown' tagging language, very interesting and easy to use:

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/felipefrancischetto/curso-jekyll/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
